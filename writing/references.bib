  abstract = {Propensity score matching estimators (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)) are widely used in evaluation research to estimate average treatment effects. In this article, we derive the large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators. Our derivations take into account that the propensity score is itself estimated in a first step, prior to matching. We prove that first step estimation of the propensity score affects the large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators, and derive adjustments to the large sample variances of propensity score matching estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). The adjustment for the ATE estimator is negative (or zero in some special cases), implying that matching on the estimated propensity score is more efficient than matching on the true propensity score in large samples. However, for the ATET estimator, the sign of the adjustment term depends on the data generating process, and ignoring the estimation error in the propensity score may lead to confidence intervals that are either too large or too small.},

  abstract = {Economic and social resources are known to contribute to the unequal distribution of health outcomes. Culturerelated factors such as normative beliefs, knowledge and behaviours have also been shown to be associated with health status. The role and function of cultural resources in the unequal distribution of health is addressed. Drawing on the work of French Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, the concept of cultural capital for its contribution to the current understanding of social inequalities in health is explored. It is suggested that class related cultural resources interact with economic and social capital in the social structuring of people’s health chances and choices. It is concluded that cultural capital is a key element in the behavioural transformation of social inequality into health inequality. New directions for empirical research on the interplay between economic, social and cultural capital are outlined.},

  abstract = {Background: Self-diagnosis is the process of diagnosing or identifying a medical condition in oneself. Artificially intelligent digital platforms for self-diagnosis are becoming widely available and are used by the general public; however, little is known about the body of knowledge surrounding this technology. Objective: The objectives of this scoping review were to (1) systematically map the extent and nature of the literature and topic areas pertaining to digital platforms that use computerized algorithms to provide users with a list of potential diagnoses and (2) identify key knowledge gaps. Methods: The following databases were searched: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Google Scholar, Open Grey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The search strategy was developed and refined with the assistance of a librarian and consisted of 3 main concepts: (1) self-diagnosis; (2) digital platforms; and (3) public or patients. The search generated 2536 articles from which 217 were duplicates. Following the Tricco et al 2018 checklist, 2 researchers screened the titles and abstracts (n=2316) and full texts (n=104), independently. A total of 19 articles were included for review, and data were retrieved following a data-charting form that was pretested by the research team. Results: The included articles were mainly conducted in the United States (n=10) or the United Kingdom (n=4). Among the articles, topic areas included accuracy or correspondence with a doctor’s diagnosis (n=6), commentaries (n=2), regulation (n=3), sociological (n=2), user experience (n=2), theoretical (n=1), privacy and security (n=1), ethical (n=1), and design (n=1). Individuals who do not have access to health care and perceive to have a stigmatizing condition are more likely to use this technology. The accuracy of this technology varied substantially based on the disease examined and platform used. Women and those with higher education were more likely to choose the right diagnosis out of the potential list of diagnoses. Regulation of this technology is lacking in most parts of the world; however, they are currently under development. Conclusions: There are prominent research gaps in the literature surrounding the use of artificially intelligent self-diagnosing digital platforms. Given the variety of digital platforms and the wide array of diseases they cover, measuring accuracy is cumbersome. More research is needed to understand the user experience and inform regulations.},

We empirically support a reconceptualization of health literacy as a social and cultural practice through which adults leverage a range of skills as well as social networks to meet their needs. Pierre Bourdieu's “theory of practice” guides this reconceptualization and facilitates articulation of the array of strategies used in the complex healthcare marketplace. We focus on the low literate consumers’ alternative forms of capital and the providers’ recognition and support. The findings, from an emergent research design consisting of depth interviews with low literate consumers and healthcare providers, suggest a critical, reflective approach that enhances health literacy, empowers consumers to become partners in their own healthcare programs, and improves health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: As telemedicine utilization increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, divergent usage patterns for video and audio-only telephone visits emerged. Older, low-income, minority, and non-English speaking Medicaid patients are at highest risk of experiencing technology access and digital literacy barriers. This raises concern for disparities in health care access and widening of the “digital divide,” the separation of those with technological access and knowledge and those without. While studies demonstrate correlation between racial and socioeconomic demographics and technological access and ability, individual patients’ perspectives of the divide and its impacts remain unclear. Objective: We aimed to interview patients to understand their perspectives on (1) the definition, causes, and impact of the digital divide; (2) whose responsibility it is to address this divide, and (3) potential solutions to mitigate the digital divide. Methods: Between December 2020 and March 2021, we conducted 54 semistructured telephone interviews with adult patients and parents of pediatric patients who had virtual visits (phone, video, or both) between March and September 2020 at the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) primary care clinics. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze interview data. Results: Patients were keenly aware of the digital divide and described impacts beyond health care, including employment, education, community and social contexts, and personal economic stability. Patients described that individuals, government, libraries, schools, health care organizations, and even private businesses all shared the responsibility to address the divide. Proposed solutions to address the divide included conducting community technology needs assessments and improving technology access, literacy training, and resource awareness. Recognizing that some individuals will never cross the divide, patients also emphasized continued support of low-tech communication methods and health care delivery to prevent widening of the digital divide. Furthermore, patients viewed technology access and literacy as drivers of the social determinants of health (SDOH), profoundly influencing how SDOH function to worsen or improve health disparities. Conclusions: Patient perspectives provide valuable insight into the digital divide and can inform solutions to mitigate health and resulting societal inequities. Future work is needed to understand the digital needs of disconnected individuals and communities. As clinical care and delivery continue to integrate telehealth, studies are needed to explore whether having a video or audio-only phone visit results in different patient outcomes and utilization. Advocacy efforts to disseminate public and private resources can also expand device and broadband internet access, improve technology literacy, and increase funding to support both high- and low-tech forms of health care delivery for the disconnected.},

  abstract = {Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have enforced numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation, and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from more than one thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods: Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia, and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in 7 languages (English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian). Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions. Results: 1047 participations (54\% women) from Asia (36\%), Africa (40\%), Europe (21\%), and others (3\%) were included in the analysis. Findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. Large decreases (p {$<$} 0.001) in the amount of social activity through family (−58\%), friends/neighbors (−44.9\%), or entertainment (−46.7\%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower life satisfaction (−30.5\%) during the confinement period. Conversely, the social contact score through digital technologies significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (+24.8\%) being socially connected through digital technology. Conclusion: These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the early COVID-19 home confinement period in 2020. Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through a technology-based solution is strongly suggested.},

This scoping review aims to assess the current situation of low digital health literacy in terms of its definition, reach, impact on health and interventions for its mitigation.                                         Methods               A comprehensive literature search strategy was composed by a qualified medical librarian. Literature databases [Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Scopus, and Google Scholar] were queried using appropriate natural language and controlled vocabulary terms along with hand-searching and citation chaining. We focused on recent and highly cited references published in English. Reviews were excluded. This scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley.                                         Results               A total of 268 articles were identified (263 from the initial search and 5 more added from the references of the original papers), 53 of which were finally selected for full text analysis. Digital health literacy is the most frequently used descriptor to refer to the ability to find and use health information with the goal of addressing or solving a health problem using technology. The most utilized tool to assess digital health literacy is the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), a self-reported measurement tool that evaluates six core dimensions and is available in various languages. Individuals with higher digital health literacy scores have better self-management and participation in their own medical decisions, mental and psychological state and quality of life. Effective interventions addressing poor digital health literacy included education/training and social support.                                         Conclusions               Although there is interest in the study and impact of poor digital health literacy, there is still a long way to go to improve measurement tools and find effective interventions to reduce the digital health divide.},

  abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject’s probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data © 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {The study aimed to investigate whether social engagement predicted longitudinally objective and subjective physical health. Measures of social engagement, subjective and objective health were taken at three points in time, 4 years apart (T1, T2, T3). Three questions were examined: does social engagement at T1 predict objective/subjective health at T2, does social engagement at T2 predict objective/subjective health at T3, and does social engagement at T1 predict objective/ subjective health at T3? Participants were 359 adults aged 65 and over. A fully cross-lagged structural equation model was examined. Social engagement at T1 was found to significantly predict subjective health at T2. However, social engagement at T1 did not significantly predict subjective health at T3, nor was subjective health at T3 predicted by social engagement at T2. Social engagement never significantly predicted objective health. Unexpectedly, objective health at T2 predicted social engagement at T3. Finally, post-hoc analyses suggest that age has a greater influence on social engagement at T2 than at T1. Social engagement is a useful predictor of subjective physical health. However, objective health was not predicted by social engagement—indeed, the converse was the case. It is suggested that the relationship between social engagement and subjective health is mediated by psychosocial factors which may not be present in the social engagement–objective health relationship. In conclusion, the results reflect the complex interplay of objective and subjective health and social engagement as people age.},

Most of the properties of cultural capital can be deduced from the fact that, in its fundamental state, it is linked to the body and presupposes embodiment. Cultural capital, in the objectified state, has a number of properties that are defined only in the relationship with cultural capital in its embodied form. By conferring institutional recognition on the cultural capital possessed by any given agent, the academic qualification also makes it possible to compare qualification holders and even to exchange them. Furthermore, it makes it possible to establish conversion rates between cultural capital and economic capital by guaranteeing the monetary value of a given academic capital.}

This has provided people with ongoing access to vital health services while minimizing their potential exposure to infection and allowing them to maintain social distancing. However, these solutions may have unintended consequences for health equity. Poverty, lack of access to digital health, poor engagement with digital health for some communities, and barriers to digital health literacy are some factors that can contribute to poor health outcomes. We present the Digital Health Equity Framework, which can be used to consider health equity factors. Along with person-centered care, digital health equity should be incorporated into health provider training and should be championed at the individual, institutional, and social levels. Important future directions will be to develop measurement-based approaches to digital health equity and to use these findings to further validate and refine this model.},

  abstract = {Objective The use of the internet as a source of health information and link to healthcare services has raised concerns about the ability of consumers, especially vulnerable populations such as older adults, to access these applications. This study examined the influence of training on the ability of adults (aged 45+ years) to use the Medicare.gov website to solve problems related to health management. The influence of computer experience and cognitive abilities on performance was also examined. Design Seventy-one participants, aged 47e92, were randomized into a Multimedia training, Unimodal training, or Cold Start condition and completed three healthcare management problems. Measurement and analyses Computer/internet experience was measured via questionnaire, and cognitive abilities were assessed using standard neuropsychological tests. Performance metrics included measures of navigation, accuracy and efficiency. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, c2 and regression techniques. Results The data indicate that there was no difference among the three conditions on measures of accuracy, efficiency, or navigation. However, results of the regression analyses showed that, overall, people who received training performed better on the tasks, as evidenced by greater accuracy and efficiency. Performance was also significantly influenced by prior computer experience and cognitive abilities. Participants with more computer experience and higher cognitive abilities performed better. Conclusions The findings indicate that training, experience, and abilities are important when using complex health websites. However, training alone is not sufficient. The complexity of web content needs to be considered to ensure successful use of these websites by those with lower abilities.},

We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable preintervention variables.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} Older adults and elderly persons can experience a significant digital divide. However, there are many studies reporting that the use of the Internet has benefits related to a person’s health status and social inclusion. It is not fully clear if Internet use and health-related outcomes share common antecedents or if using the Internet may have a favourable effect on the determinants responsible for good health. The main aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the use of the Internet and health-related outcomes in older adults and elderly people in Poland. Methods:\enspace{} The effect of the use of the Internet was analysed with regression models after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. The data used for the analysis were obtained through a telephone-based survey on a representative sample of Polish adults at least 50 years of age. Results:\enspace{} By categorising the frequency of Internet use by the respondents, it was found that some categories were significantly related to less favourable health behaviours. Rare Internet users were less likely to undertake physical activity than nonusers (odds ratio, OR, 95\% confidence interval, 95\%CI 0.48, 0.28–0.83). Those using the Internet every day less frequently consumed fruit and vegetables (OR, 95\%CI 0.64, 0.42–0.99). Internet use was also associated with more frequent consumption of alcohol (OR, 95\%CI 1.65, 1.09–2.50 comparing nonusers with those accessing the Internet several times a week). Persons rarely using the Internet, but not those who accessed it at least a few times a week, possessed a lower health literacy than nonusers (OR, 95\%CI 0.71, 0.52–0.97). Internet users were also more likely to assess their health status as unsatisfactory (OR, 95\%CI 0.59, 0.42–0.82 comparing nonusers with those using the Internet daily). Finally, the use of the Internet was consistently associated with a lower prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, as well as less frequent visits to health care facilities. Conclusions:\enspace{} In conclusion, in contrast to earlier findings, Internet use is not associated with favourable patterns of lifestyle or higher self-rated health in older Polish adults. However, persons with chronic conditions or disabilities less frequently declare the use of the Internet. It was also revealed that older adults and the elderly who make use of the Internet are less likely to utilise health services.},

  abstract = {Background: The Internet is increasingly becoming an infrastructure for a number of services, both commercial, public (including health related) and personal. Using the internet have the potential to promote social interaction and social connectedness by upholding social networks and social contacts. However, Internet use is lower in older adults compared to other age groups. This digital divide is considered a risk to the health of older adults since it limits their participation in society, access and use of relevant health related information and services. This study focuses on whether there is an association between Internet use and self-rated health. Method: A cross-sectional population-based sample of 70-year-olds from The Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study (n = 1136) was examined in 2014–16. All data was collected using structured interviews and questionnaires. Differences in proportions were tested with chi-square test and ordinary least square regression analysis was used to estimate the relationship between Internet use and self-rated health controlling for health factors, hearing and visual impairment, and social contacts. Results: There is a relationship between more frequent Internet use and good self-rated health (unstandardized β 0.101 p {$<$} 0.001), and the effect remained after adjusting for all covariates (unstandardized β 0.082 p {$<$} 0.001). Our results also show that, in comparison to health factors, Internet use is of minor importance to the SRH of older adults, since adding these improved the explanatory power of the model by approximately 400\% (from 0.04 to 0.18). Conclusion: Although the direction of the relationship between more frequent interne use and better self-rated health is undetermined in the present study, it can be suggested that using the Internet informs and educates older adults, strengthening their position as active and engaged participants of society. It can also be suggested that those using the Internet report less loneliness and a possibility to establish new computer-mediated relationships within online communities. Further research needs to examine what aspects of Internet use, and in what contexts such positive perceptions arise.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTThis paper (which is mainly expository) sets up graphical models for causation, having a bit less than the usual complement of hypothetical counterfactuals. Assuming the invariance of error distributions may be essential for causal inference, but the errors themselves need not be invariant. Graphs can be interpreted using conditional distributions, so that we can better address connections between the mathematical framework and causality in the world. The identification problem is posed in terms of conditionals. As will be seen, causal relationships cannot be inferred from a data set by running regressions unless there is substantial prior knowledge about the mechanisms that generated the data. The idea can be made more precise in several ways. There are few successful applications of graphical models, mainly because few causal pathways can be excluded on a priori grounds. The invariance conditions themselves remain to be assessed.INTRODUCTIONIn this paper, I review the logical basis for inferring causation from regression equations, proceeding by example. The starting point is a simple regression; next is a path model, and then simultaneous equations (for supply and demand). After that come nonlinear graphical models. The key to making a causal inference from nonexperimental data by regression is some kind of invariance, exogeneity being a subsidiary problem. Parameters need to be invariant to interventions: this well-known condition will be stated here with a little more precision than is customary. Invariance is also needed for (i) errors or (ii) error distributions, a topic that has attracted less attention. Invariance for distributions is a weaker assumption than invariance for errors.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 is one of the most deadly diseases to have stricken us in recent decades. In the fight against this disease, governments and stakeholders require all the assistance they can get from various systems, including digital health interventions. Digital health technologies are supporting the tracking of the COVID-19 outbreak, diagnosing patients, expediting the process of finding potential medicines and vaccines, and disinfecting the environment, The establishment of electronic medical and health records, computerized clinical decision support systems, telemedicine, and mobile health have shown the potential to strengthen the healthcare system. Recently, these technologies have aided the health sector in a variety of ways, including prevention, early diagnosis, treatment adherence, medication safety, care coordination, documentation, data management, outbreak tracking, and pandemic surveillance. On the other hand, implementation of such technologies has questions of cost, compatibility with existing systems, disruption in patient-provider interactions, and sustainability, calling for more evidence on clinical utility and economic evaluations to help shape the next generation of healthcare. This paper argues how digital health interventions assist in the fight against COVID-19 and their opportunities, implications, and limitations.},

  abstract = {Study of brain tumors (BT) has revealed the importance of cognitive and behavioral assessment to clinical care and prognosis. This paper overviews recent literature, focusing on the main points of interest and current methods, providing recommendations for advancing research. Histological aspects, disease progression, treatment-related neurotoxicity, and co-morbidities determine the cognitive patterns of BT. Mental slowing with prominent executive and memory compromise usually mark the advanced phases of disease, whereas normal cognitive performance or subtle behavioral symptoms characterize the early disease course, irrespective of tumor location. Neurocognitive assessment may indicate brain damage in otherwise neurologically normal patients, explain pathological behavior, and provide reliable measures of outcome, contributing to improving the management of patients. Scarce attention has been devoted to social cognitive deficits which are expected to impair autonomy and relationships. Interest in non-pharmacological treatment of cognitive impairment is a growing area although methodological difficulties persist. Homogeneous patient populations, longitudinal study designs including baseline evaluations, and measurement of the lowest and highest levels of cognitive performance seem indispensable to advancing the study of the cognitive and behavioral changes provoked by BT. Future investigations are also expected to clarify the clinical significance of such changes, their effect on quality of life, and the efficacy of specific rehabilitation treatments.},

Method: Three waves of data from a representative cohort study of community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and above from the New Haven Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly are examined using random effects models. Results: Social engagement (an index combining social and productive activity) is associated with lower CES-D scores after adjustment for age, sex, time, education, marital status, health and functional status, and fitness activities. This association is generally constant with time, suggesting a cross-sectional association. In addition, social engagement is associated with change in depressive symptoms, but only among those with CES-D scores below 16 at baseline. Discussion: Social engagement is independently associated with depressive symptoms cross-sectionally. A longitudinal association is seen only among those not depressed at baseline.},

  abstract = {Background: Older people are among the segments of the population for which the digital divide is most persistent and are considered to be at risk of losing out on the potential benefits that the information society can provide to their quality of life. Little attention has been paid, however, to relationships between Internet use and actual indicators of health among older people. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association between Internet use and self-rated health among older people and determine whether this association holds independently of socioeconomic position. Methods: Data were from a survey about the digital divide and quality of life among older people in Spain that was conducted in 2008. The final sample consisted of 709 individuals and was representative of the Spanish adult population in terms of Internet use and sex across two age groups (55-64 and 65-74 years). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between Internet use and self-rated health. Results: Results initially showed a significant relationship between Internet use and poor self-rated health (Model 1, OR = 0.32, 95\% CI 0.16-0.67, P = .002), suggesting that Internet users have better self-rated health than nonusers. This effect remained significant when other sociodemographic variables were entered into the equation (Model 2, OR = 0.39, 95\% CI 0.18-0.83, P = .01; Model 3, OR = 0.41, 95\% CI 0.19-0.87, P = .02). However, the significant relationship between Internet use and self-rated health disappeared once social class was considered (Model 4, OR = 0.61, 95\% CI 0.27-1.37, P = .23). Conclusions: This study suggests that the use of the Internet is not a significant determinant of health among older people once the socioeconomic position of individuals is taken into account.},

  abstract = {Background: Access to internet-enabled technology and Web-based services has grown exponentially in recent decades. This growth potentially excludes some communities and individuals with mental health difficulties, who face a heightened risk of digital exclusion. However, it is unclear what factors may contribute to digital exclusion in this population. Objective: To explore in detail the problems of digital exclusion in mental health service users and potential facilitators to overcome them. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 20 mental health service users who were deemed digitally excluded. We recruited the participants from a large secondary mental health provider in South London, United Kingdom. We employed thematic analysis to identify themes and subthemes relating to historical and extant reasons for digital exclusion and methods of overcoming it. Results: There were three major themes that appeared to maintain digital exclusion: a perceived lack of knowledge, being unable to access the necessary technology and services owing to personal circumstances, and the barriers presented by mental health difficulties. Specific facilitators for overcoming digital exclusion included intrinsic motivation and a personalized learning format that reflects the individual’s unique needs and preferences. Conclusions: Multiple factors contribute to digital exclusion among mental health service users, including material deprivation and mental health difficulties. This means that efforts to overcome digital exclusion must address the multiple deprivations individuals may face in the offline world in addition to their individual mental health needs. Additional facilitators include fostering an intrinsic motivation to overcome digital exclusion and providing a personalized learning format tailored to the individual’s knowledge gaps and preferred learning style.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding how people with diabetes seek online health information and use health applications is important to ensure these electronic tools are successfully supporting patient self-care. Furthermore, identifying the relationship between patient mobile eHealth literacy (mobile eHL) and diabetes outcomes can have far-reaching utility, for example, in the design of targeted interventions to address mobile eHL limitations. However, only limited studies have explored the impact of mobile eHL in a population with diabetes. Objective: This study aims to present data about online information-seeking behavior and mobile health (mHealth) app usage, investigate the factors related to mobile eHL in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes, and flesh out the relationship between eHealth literacy (eHL), mobile health literacy (mHL), and health outcomes. Methods: Subjects were recruited from January 2017 to December 2017 in the outpatient departments of 3 hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 249 Taiwanese patients with diabetes voluntarily completed a cross-sectional survey assessing sociodemographic characteristics; diabetes status; knowledge and skills of computers, the internet, and mobile apps; mobile eHL; and patient outcomes (self-care behaviors, self-rated health, HbA1c). Structural equation modeling analyses examined the model fit of mobile eHL scores and the interrelationships between latent constructs and observable variables. Results: Of the 249 patients with diabetes, 67\% (164/249) reported they had searched for online diabetes information. The participants with smartphones had owned them for an average of 6.5 years and used them for an average of 4.5 (SD 3.81) hours per day. Only 1.6\% (4/249) of the patients used health apps. Some demographic factors affecting mobile eHL included age, education, and duration of type 2 diabetes. Mobile eHL was related to self-care behaviors as well as knowledge and skills of computers, the internet, and mobile technology, but only had a weak, indirect effect on self-rated health. The final model had adequate goodness-of-fit indexes: chi-square (83)=149.572, P{$<$}.001; comparative fit index (CFI)=0.925; root mean square of approximation (RMSEA)=0.057 (90\% CI 004-006); chi-square/df=1.082. Mobile eHL had a weak, indirect effect on self-rated health through the variables of knowledge with skills. Conclusions: Our study reveals that although people with diabetes who rated their health conditions as moderate were confident in using mobile eHealth and technology, few adopted these tools in their daily lives. The study found that mobile eHL had a direct effect on self-care behavior as well as knowledge and skills of computers, the internet, and mobile technology, and had an indirect},

Innovations in health information technology (HIT) provide opportunities to reduce health care spending, improve quality of care, and improve health outcomes for older adults. However, concerns relating to older adults’ limited access and use of HIT, including use of the Internet for health information, fuel the digital health divide debate. This study evaluated the potential digital health divide in relation to characteristic and belief differences between older adult users and nonusers of online health information sources. Methods. A cross-sectional survey design was conducted using a random sample of older adults. A total of 225 older adults (age range = 50-92 years, M = 68.9 years, SD = 10.4) participated in the study. Results. Seventy-six percent of all respondents had Internet access. Users and nonusers of online health information differed significantly on age (M = 66.29 vs. M = 71.13), education, and previous experience with the health care system. Users and nonusers of online health information also differed significantly on Internet and technology access, however, a large percentage of nonusers had Internet access (56.3\%), desktop computers (55.9\%), and laptop computers or netbooks (43.2\%). Users of online health information had higher mean scores on the Computer Self-Efficacy Measure than nonusers, t(159) = −7.29, p {$<$} .0001. Conclusion. This study found significant differences between older adult users and nonusers of online health information. Findings suggest strategies for reducing this divide and implications for health education programs to promote HIT use among older adults.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} The number of older adults with physical multi-morbidity is increasing. As Internet-based eHealth and mHealth increasingly require patients to use technology, it is important to examine the use of Internet/health information technology (HIT) among older adults with physical multi-morbidity. Here we examine the distribution of physical multi-morbidity, Internet use, and HIT use, and further explored the factors associated with Internet use and HIT use among older adults with physical multi-morbidity. Methods:\enspace{} One wave of data from the 2018 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was analysed. We included respondents aged 65 years and older. We used 13 physical non-communicable diseases to measure physical multimorbidity. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models, with sociodemographic factors, health status, health insurance, health care service use, and satisfaction with health care as covariates, were used to examine the research questions. Results:\enspace{} Of 72,746 respondents in NHIS, 7060 were eligible for our analysis. 5380 (76.2\%) eligible respondents had physical multi-morbidity in this study. Overall, 60\% of older adults reported using the Internet, with 38.9\% using eHealth services (defined as looking up health information online, filling a prescription, scheduling an appointment with a health care provider, or communicating with a health care provider via email). Gender, age, marital status, region, race, education, and family income were significant factors associated with the Internet and HIT use among people with multi-morbidity. The study also showed that after adjusting for confounders, good health status, having Medicare, receiving home care from a health professional, and low satisfaction with health care were positive predictors of the Internet and HIT use. Conclusions:\enspace{} In summary, our study found that Internet and HIT use among older patients with chronic diseases is far from the Healthy People 2030 target. Internet and HIT use vary depending on a number of sociodemographic factors. Relevant influencing factors should be fully considered in health education interventions promoted.},

They are also an important means by which to study how people experience, interpret, and respond to change. Accordingly, they are a prime means to study development at individual, group, and societal levels.

  abstract = {To better understand how medication status and task demands affect cognition in major depressive disorder (MDD), we evaluated medication-naïve patients with MDD, medicated patients with MDD receiving the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) paroxetine, and healthy controls. All three groups were administered a computer-based cognitive task with two phases, an initial phase in which a sequence is learned through reward-based feedback (which our prior studies suggest is striataldependent), followed by a generalization phase that involves a change in the context where learned rules are to be applied (which our prior studies suggest is hippocampal-region dependent). Medication-naïve MDD patients were slow to learn the initial sequence but were normal on subsequent generalization of that learning. In contrast, medicated patients learned the initial sequence normally, but were impaired at the generalization phase. We argue that these data suggest (i) an MDD-related impairment in striataldependent sequence learning which can be remediated by SSRIs and (ii) an SSRI-induced impairment in hippocampal-dependent generalization of past learning to novel contexts, not otherwise seen in the medication-naïve MDD group. Thus, SSRIs might have a beneficial effect on striatal function required for sequence learning, but a detrimental effect on the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures is critical for generalization.},

  abstract = {Background: The digital divide persists despite broad accessibility of mobile tools. The relationship between the digital divide and health disparities reflects social status in terms of access to resources and health outcomes; however, data on this relationship are limited from developing countries such as China. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the current rates of access to mobile tools (Internet use and mobile phone ownership) among older Chinese individuals (aged ≥45 years), the predictors of access at individual and community levels, and the relationship between access to mobile tools and health outcomes. Methods: We drew cross-sectional data from a national representative survey, the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which focused on the older population (aged ≥45 years). We used two-level mixed logistic regression models, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity at the community and individual levels for data analysis. In addition to individual-level socioeconomic status (SES), we included community-level resources such as neighborhood amenities, health care facilities, and community organizations. Health outcomes were measured by self-reported health and absence of disability based on validated scales. Results: Among the 18,215 participants, 6.51\% had used the Internet in the past month, and 83\% owned a mobile phone. In the multivariate models, Internet use was strongly associated with SES, rural or urban residence, neighborhood amenities, community resources, and geographic region. Mobile phone ownership was strongly associated with SES and rural/urban residence but not so much with neighborhood amenities and community resources. Internet use was a significant predictor of self-reported health status, and mobile phone ownership was significantly associated with having disability even after controlling for potential confounders at the individual and community levels. Conclusions: This study is one of the first to examine digital divide and its relationship with health disparities in China. The data showed a significant digital divide in China, especially in the older population. Internet access is still limited to people with higher SES; however, the mobile phone has been adopted by the general population. The digital divide is associated with not only individual SES but also community resources. Future electronic health (eHealth) programs need to consider the accessibility of mobile tools and develop culturally appropriate programs for various social groups.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Although several studies have examined the individual relationships among digital literacy, cognitive function, and depressive symptoms, few have integrated all three factors into a single model. This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the mediating effect of depressive symptoms on the relationship between digital literacy and cognition. In doing so, we hoped to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay among these variables and their implications for mental health and well-being.                                         Methods               Participants were 7,988 older adults (65\,years or older) who participated in the Living Profiles of Older People Survey 2020. The main type of exposure was digital literacy (communication, information, media, and online transaction literacy). The main outcomes were depressive symptoms measured using the Short Geriatric Depression Scale of Korean version and cognitive function measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination score. Multiple linear regression and mediation analyses were also performed.                                         Results               After adjusting for covariates, our analysis found a significant association between digital literacy and both depressive symptoms and cognitive function (β of four types of digital literacy and depressive symptoms\,=\,−0.123, −0.172, −0.702, and\,−\,0.639, respectively; β of four types of digital literacy and cognitive function\,=\,2.102, 2.217, 1.711, and 1.436, respectively). Moreover, our study showed that depressive symptoms play a mediating role in the relationship between media and online transaction literacy and cognitive function (95\% CI of indirect effects\,=\,0.0647–0.1212 and 0.0639–0.1277, respectively), implying an indirect pathway (digital literacy, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function).                                         Discussion               This study sheds light on the relationship between digital literacy, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function in older adults. We found that depressive symptoms mediated the association between specific aspects of digital literacy (online transaction and media literacy) and cognitive function. Our results indicate that community-based digital literacy programs could be effective in reducing depression and preserving or improving cognitive function in older adults.},

Because even briefer measures might be desirable for use in busy clinical settings or as part of comprehensive health questionnaires, we evaluated a 2-item version of the PHQ depression module, the PHQ-2.           Methods. ~           The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each as 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). The PHQ-2 was completed by 6000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics–gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.           Results. ~           As PHQ-2 depression severity increased from 0 to 6, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-2 score ≥3 had a sensitivity of 83\% and a specificity of 92\% for major depression. Likelihood ratio and receiver operator characteristic analysis identified a PHQ-2 score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint for screening purposes. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics–gynecology samples.           Conclusion. ~           The construct and criterion validity of the PHQ-2 make it an attractive measure for depression screening.},

  abstract = {Background: There is uncertainty about the impact of internet use on mental health in older adults. Moreover, there is very little known specifically about the impact of particular purposes of internet use. Objective: This study aims to investigate the longitudinal relationship between two distinct concepts of mental health with the frequency of internet use among older adults: the moderating role of socioeconomic position (SEP) and the association between specific purposes of internet use. Methods: Longitudinal fixed and random effects (27,507 person-years) models were fitted using waves 6-8 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to examine the relationship between different aspects of internet use (frequency and purpose) and two mental health outcomes (depression and life satisfaction). The potential moderating effect of SEP on these associations was tested using interaction terms. Results: Infrequent internet use (monthly or less vs daily) was predictive of deteriorating life satisfaction (β=−0.512; P=.02) but not depression. Education and occupational class had a moderating effect on the association between frequency of internet use and mental health. The associations were stronger in the highest educational group in both depression (P=.09) and life satisfaction (P=.02), and in the highest occupational group in life satisfaction (P=.05) only. Using the internet for communication was associated with lower depression (β=−0.24; P=.002) and better life satisfaction (β=.97; P{$<$}.001), whereas those using the internet for information access had worse life satisfaction (β=−0.86; P{$<$}.001) compared with those who did not. Conclusions: Policies to improve mental health in older adults should encourage internet use, especially as a tool to aid communication.},

Data were analysed using logistic regression analyses with bootstrapping resampling and estimation statistical technique. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders there was a significant association between use of the Internet and better mental health among older care-givers. There was an approximately 60\% increase in the odds of better mental health (OR ¼ 1.56, 95\% CI ¼ 1.04–2.35) for care-givers who used the Internet in the past 12 months when compared with those who did not. Conclusions: The use of Internet has a beneficial effect on the mental health of care-giver aged 60 years or above.

Mood disorders, as defined by the World Mental Health and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, have a 12-month prevalence which varies from 3\% in Japan to over 9\% in the US. A recent American survey found the prevalence of current depression to be 9\% and the rate of current major depression to be 3.4\%. All studies of depressive disorders have stressed the importance of the mortality and morbidity associated with depression. The mortality risk for suicide in depressed patients is more than 20-fold greater than in the general population. Recent studies have also shown the importance of depression as a risk factor for cardiovascular death. The risk of cardiac mortality after an initial myocardial infarction is greater in patients with depression and related to the severity of the depressive episode. Greater severity of depressive symptoms has been found to be associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality including cardiovascular death and stroke. In addition to mortality, functional impairment and disability associated with depression have been consistently reported. Depression increases the risk of decreased workplace productivity and absenteeism resulting in lowered income or unemployment. Absenteeism and presenteeism (being physically present at work but functioning suboptimally) have been estimated to result in a loss of \$36.6 billion per year in the US. Worldwide projections by the World Health Organization for the year 2030 identify unipolar major depression as the leading cause of disease burden.

  abstract = {This paper combines multiple cross-sections of data drawn from the National Population Health Survey and Canadian Community Health Survey to confirm the existence of the ‘healthy immigrant effect’, specifically that immigrants are in relatively better health on arrival in Canada compared to native-born Canadians, and that immigrant health converges with years in Canada to native-born levels. The paper finds robust evidence that the healthy immigrant effect is present for the incidence of chronic conditions for both men and women, and results in relatively slow convergence to native-born levels. There is only weak evidence in terms of self-assessed health status. The inclusion of controls for region of origin and year of arrival does not account for the observed effects, although region of origin is an important determinants of immigrant health. The paper then considers some alternative explanations for the observed differences, and support is found for the idea that the healthy immigrant effect reflects convergence in physical health rather than convergence in screening and detection of existing health problems.},

  abstract = {Background: Electronic health resources are helpful only when people are able to use them, yet there remain few tools available to assess consumers’ capacity for engaging in eHealth. Over 40\% of US and Canadian adults have low basic literacy levels, suggesting that eHealth resources are likely to be inaccessible to large segments of the population. Using information technology for health requires eHealth literacy—the ability to read, use computers, search for information, understand health information, and put it into context. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was designed (1) to assess consumers’ perceived skills at using information technology for health and (2) to aid in determining the fit between eHealth programs and consumers. Objectives: The eHEALS is an 8-item measure of eHealth literacy developed to measure consumers’ combined knowledge, comfort, and perceived skills at finding, evaluating, and applying electronic health information to health problems. The objective of the study was to psychometrically evaluate the properties of the eHEALS within a population context. A youth population was chosen as the focus for the initial development primarily because they have high levels of eHealth use and familiarity with information technology tools. Methods: Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 3- and 6-month follow-up using control group data as part of a single session, randomized intervention trial evaluating Web-based eHealth programs. Scale reliability was tested using item analysis for internal consistency (coefficient alpha) and test-retest reliability estimates. Principal components factor analysis was used to determine the theoretical fit of the measures with the data. Results: A total of 664 participants (370 boys; 294 girls) aged 13 to 21 (mean = 14.95; SD = 1.24) completed the eHEALS at four time points over 6 months. Item analysis was performed on the 8-item scale at baseline, producing a tight fitting scale with α = .88. Item-scale correlations ranged from r = .51 to .76. Test-retest reliability showed modest stability over time from baseline to 6-month follow-up (r = .68 to .40). Principal components analysis produced a single factor solution (56\% of variance). Factor loadings ranged from .60 to .84 among the 8 items. Conclusions: The eHEALS reliably and consistently captures the eHealth literacy concept in repeated administrations, showing promise as tool for assessing consumer comfort and skill in using information technology for health. Within a clinical environment, the eHEALS has the potential to serve as a means of identifying those who may or may not benefit from referrals to an eHealth intervention or resource. Further research needs to examine the applicability of the eHEALS to other populations and settings while exploring the relationship between eHealth literacy and health care outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Numerous instruments are designed to measure digital literacy among the general population. However, few studies have assessed the use and appropriateness of these measurements for older populations. Objective: This systematic review aims to identify and critically appraise studies assessing digital literacy among older adults and to evaluate how digital literacy instruments used in existing studies address the elements of age-appropriate digital literacy using the European Commission’s Digital Competence (DigComp) Framework. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies using validated instruments to assess digital literacy among older adults. The quality of all included studies was evaluated using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT). Instruments were assessed according to their ability to incorporate the competence areas of digital literacy as defined by the DigComp Framework: (1) information and data literacy, (2) communication and collaboration, (3) digital content creation, (4) safety, and (5) problem-solving ability, or attitudes toward information and communication technology use. Results: Searches yielded 1561 studies, of which 27 studies (17 cross-sectional, 2 before and after, 2 randomized controlled trials, 1 longitudinal, and 1 mixed methods) were included in the final analysis. Studies were conducted in the United States (18/27), Germany (3/27), China (1/27), Italy (1/27), Sweden (1/27), Canada (1/27), Iran (1/27), and Bangladesh (1/27). Studies mostly defined older adults as aged ≥50 years (10/27) or ≥60 years (8/27). Overall, the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was the most frequently used instrument measuring digital literacy among older adults (16/27, 59\%). Scores on the CCAT ranged from 34 (34/40, 85\%) to 40 (40/40, 100\%). Most instruments measured 1 or 2 of the DigComp Framework’s elements, but the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ) measured all 5 elements, including “digital content creation” and “safety.” Conclusions: The current digital literacy assessment instruments targeting older adults have both strengths and weaknesses, relative to their study design, administration method, and ease of use. Certain instrument modalities like the MDPQ are more generalizable and inclusive and thus, favorable for measuring the digital literacy of older adults. More studies focusing on the suitability of such instruments for older populations are warranted, especially for areas like “digital content creation” and “safety” that currently lack assessment. Evidence-based discussions regarding the implications of digitalization for the treatment of older adults and how health care professionals may benefit from this phenomenon are encouraged.},

  abstract = {Background: Web-based health interventions can drive behavior change, but their effectiveness depends on participants’ usage. A well-recognized challenge with these interventions is nonusage attrition or weak engagement that results in participants receiving low doses of the intervention, negatively affecting outcomes. We present an approach based on the theoretical concepts of social influence and complex contagion in an effort to address the engagement problem in a specific, commercial, online behavior change intervention. Objective: To examine the relation between social ties and engagement within a specific online intervention. The aims were (1) to determine whether experiencing the intervention socially influences engagement, such that individuals with social ties show higher engagement than those without ties, and (2) to evaluate whether complex contagion increases engagement—that is, whether engagement increases as the number of ties an individual has in the intervention increases. Methods: We analyzed observational data from 84,828 subscribed members of a specific Web-based intervention, Daily Challenge. We compiled three measures of engagement for every member: email opens, site visits, and challenge completions (response to action prompts). We compared members with and without social ties within the intervention on each measure separately using 2-tailed independent-sample t tests. Finally, we performed linear regressions with each simple engagement measure as the dependent variable and number of social ties as the independent variable. Results: Compared with those without social ties, participants with social ties opened more emails (33.0\% vs 27.2\%, P {$<$} .001), visited the website more often (12.6 vs 6.7 visits, P {$<$} .001), and reported completing more of the actions they were prompted to perform (11.0 vs 6.1 actions, P {$<$} .001). Social ties were significant predictors of email opens (beta = 0.68, P {$<$} .001), site visits (beta = 1.52, P {$<$} .001), and reported action completions (beta = 1.32, P {$<$} .001). Conclusions: Our initial findings are higher engagement in participants with social ties in the program and are consistent with the view that social influence can drive engagement in a Web-based health intervention.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the prospective relation of social engagement with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, taking into account behavioral factors (smoking, physical activity, body weight, and alcohol consumption), socioeconomic factors, and presence of comorbidity and disability. METHODS: A socioeconomically representative cohort of 5925 men aged 52–74 years from 24 British towns was followed up from 1992–2006. A scale from 0–9 was used based on questions reflecting the frequency and extent of social engagement in 1992. RESULTS: CVD mortality risk decreased with increasing social engagement scoredage-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for those with the highest social engagement score of 8–9 was 0.42 (95\% confidence interval [95\%CI], 0.32–0.53) compared to those with the lowest scores of 0–3 (p for trend {$<$} 0.0001). Further adjustment for behavioral factors (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, and body weight), disability, comorbidity, and socioeconomic factors reduced the strength of this association, although strong evidence of an association remained: HR 0.70 (95\%CI, 0.53–0.93) for highest versus lowest social engagement scores (p for trend Z 0.0004). Although the association appeared somewhat stronger in subjects with preexisting CVD (HR 0.59 for highest vs. lowest social engagement scores) than in those without (HR 0.79), there was no evidence of an interaction between social engagement and preexisting CVD (p Z 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: In our study of older men, social engagement appeared to have a modest protective effect on CVD mortality independent of behavioral factors, socioeconomic conditions, disease, and disability.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Smart watches have the potential to support health in everyday living by: enabling self-monitoring of personal activity; obtaining feedback based on activity measures; allowing for in-situ surveys to identify patterns of behavior; and supporting bi-directional communication with health care providers and family members. However, smart watches are an emerging technology and research with these devices is at a nascent stage. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of smart watch studies that engaged people in their use by searching PubMed, Embase, IEEE XPlore and ACM Digital libraries. Participant demographics, device features, watch applications and methods, and technical challenges were abstracted from included studies. Results: Seventy-three studies were returned in the search. Seventeen studies published were included. Included studies were published from 2014 to 2016, with the exception of one published in 2011. Most studies employed the use of consumer-grade smart watches (14/17, 82\%). Patient-related studies focused on activity monitoring, heart rate monitoring, speech therapy adherence, diabetes self-management, and detection of seizures, tremors, scratching, eating, and medication-taking behaviors. Most patient-related studies enrolled participants with few exclusion criteria to validate smart watch function (10/17, 58\%). Only studies that focused on Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and diabetes management enrolled persons living with targeted conditions. One study focused on nursing work in the ICU and one focused on CPR training for laypeople. Conclusion: Consumer-grade smart watches have penetrated the health research space rapidly since 2014. Smart watch technical function, acceptability, and effectiveness in supporting health must be validated in larger field studies that enroll actual participants living with the conditions these devices target.},

We investigate associations between the measure and physical, psychological, and cognitive function. The results provide insights into the relationships between a set of biological profiles and various health outcomes, identify limitations of earlier approaches, and underscore next steps in the development of improved formulations of physiological dysregulation.},

In this article, we introduce a general framework of sensitivity analysis that is based on inverse probability weighting. We propose a general methodology that allows both non‐parametric and parametric analyses, which are driven by two parameters that govern the magnitude of the variation of the multiplicative errors of the propensity score and their correlations with the potential outcomes. We also introduce a specific parametric model that offers a mechanistic view on how the uncontrolled confounding may bias the inference through these parameters. Our method can be readily applied to both binary and continuous outcomes and depends on the covariates only through the propensity score that can be estimated by any parametric or non‐parametric method. We illustrate our method with two medical data sets.},

I define cultural health capital as the repertoire of cultural skills, verbal and nonverbal competencies, attitudes and behaviors, and interactional styles, cultivated by patients and clinicians alike, that, when deployed, may result in more optimal health care relationships. I consider cultural health capital alongside existing frameworks for understanding clinical interactions, and I argue that the concept of cultural health capital offers theoretical traction to help account for several dynamics of unequal treatment. These dynamics include the often nonpurposeful, habitual nature of culturally-mediated interactional styles; their growing importance amidst sociocultural changes in U.S. health care; their direct and indirect effects as instrumental as well as symbolic forms of capital; and their ability to account for the systematic yet variable relationship between social status and health care interactions.},

Much of this has focused on different mobile devices, individual preferences and modes of use. Yet social activity and connectedness are about ongoing enactments of relationships across technologies. We propose the relational lens as a way to include a notion of relational tension in addition to individual preferences in the design and analysis of mobile communication technologies. We discuss three strategies people use to manage tensions in their relationships: selection, segmentation and integration. Our data show that use of social technologies can at times destabilize social relations and occasion relational tensions, forcing users to renegotiate how they enact these relationships.},

  abstract = {When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970s, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods—or developing methods related to matching—do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

We ultimately explore policies in Sweden, Australia, Canada, Estonia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to learn how policies can lay an inclusive foundation for digital health systems. We conclude that digital health ecosystems should be designed with health equity at the forefront to avoid deepening existing health inequalities. We call for a more sophisticated understanding of digital health literacy to better assess the readiness to adopt digital health innovations. Finally, people living with disabilities should be positioned at the center of digital health policy and innovations to ensure they are not left behind.},

  abstract = {The WHO has stated that the number of senior citizens above age 65 across the world will double by the year 2050: in the UK, the whole population is projected to grow by about 2.5\% over a decade, from mid-2018. Although people are living longer, they are not healthier in old age, and there is an increasing number of illnesses and disabilities in the ageing population, which have an impact on their overall well-being and quality of life (QoL). Alongside these trends, Internet technologies have improved and provide a wide range of information, including on medical and health issues. This study aimed to examine the association between the utilisation of the internet among older people in England and their QoL. This study utilised the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), a longitudinal study of a representative sample of people aged 50 and over in England. The data from Wave 9 were analysed using bivariate analysis and logistic regression. The results show a strong association between QoL and utilisation of the Internet in older people, even when adjusting for demographic variables and health. Higher use of the internet was associated with older people being less likely to have higher QoL. The excessive use of the internet for communication and gathering information also contributed to lower QoL. From the findings, poorer QoL was also found in people in older age groups, in those who are married, and those who never suffer from chronic diseases. Our findings suggest that the quality of life in older people might not only be associated with the frequency of usage but also the purpose for which the internet is used; however, this relationship is complex and further research should explore this in greater depth. Further research should also investigate how older people’s use of the Internet changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of this on the QoL in older age.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Cognitive impairment is commonly reported by breast cancer survivors, yet little is known regarding its impact on quality of life. The purpose of this study was to obtain a better understanding of breast cancer survivors’ experiences of perceived cognitive impairment, its trajectory, and its impact on relationships, daily functioning, work and overall life satisfaction after breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The results are based on qualitative interviews with 22 breast cancer survivors who reported cognitive impairment and who were at least 1 year post-chemotherapy treatment. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a content analysis approach. Results: Breast cancer survivors’ primarily expressed concerns in 6 major domains including: short-term memory, long-term memory, speed of processing, attention and concentration, language and executive functioning. Concerns emerged as salient after treatment ended as other problems resolved. All of the survivors found these impairments frustrating, and some also reported these changes as detrimental to their self-confidence and social relationships. Employed survivors reported working harder to perform tasks and use of compensatory strategies to complete work tasks. Validation of perceived cognitive impairment by family, friends, and healthcare providers was perceived as important to adjustment. Conclusions: Perceived cognitive deficits have broad implications for the well-being of breast cancer survivors. Study findings underscore the broad consequences of this symptom, provide direction for theory development, measurement selection, and additional intervention targets. A greater understanding of cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors may lead to the development of effective treatment of this symptom.},

Active ageing: A strategic policy solution to demographic ageing in the European Union             The ageing of European countries has widespread implications for current and future social and economic policies across the region. The major policy response to demographic ageing that has emerged over the past 10 years is called ‘active ageing’, yet there is little clarity in practice about what it means for individuals and society beyond a crude economic reduction in terms of working longer. The main purposes of this article are to explain why this strategy has emerged and its importance. Despite a great deal of positive political rhetoric, the response at all levels of policy making has been rather limited. An active social and public policy is required to mainstream active ageing as the leading paradigm for ageing policy across the European Union (EU). The designation of 2012 as the European Year of Active Ageing offers a potential focus for renewed policy action in the EU and is discussed in the context of our conclusions.},

  abstract = {Background: Self-rated health (SRH), a subjective assessment of health status, is extensively used in the public health field. However, whether SRH can reflect the objective health status is still debatable. We aim to reveal the relationship between SRH and objective health status in the general population. Methods: We assessed the relationship between SRH and objective health status by examining the prevalence of diseases, laboratory parameters, and some health-related factors in different SRH groups. Data were collected from 18,000 residents randomly sampled from the general population in five cities of China (3,600 in each city). SRH was assessed by a single-item health measure with five options: “very good,” “good,” “fair,” “bad,” and “very bad.” The differences in prevalence of diseases, laboratory parameters, and health-related factors between the “healthy” (very good plus good), “relatively healthy” (fair), and “unhealthy” (bad plus very bad) groups were examined. The odds ratios (ORs) referenced by the healthy group were calculated using logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of all diseases was associated with poorer SRH. The tendency was more prominent in cardio-cerebral vascular diseases, visual impairment, and mental illnesses with larger ORs. Residents with abnormalities in laboratory parameters tended to have poorer SRH, with ORs ranging from 1.62 (for triglyceride) to 3.48 (for hemoglobin among men) in a comparison of the unhealthy and healthy groups. Most of the healthrelated factors regarded as risks were associated with poorer SRH. Among them, life and work pressure, poor spiritual status, and poor quality of interpersonal relationships were the most significant factors. Conclusions: SRH is consistent with objective health status and can serve as a global measure of health status in the general population.},

Based on data from the China Family Panel Studies of 2016 (N = 15,147), we first harnessed a binary logistic regression model to discuss the associations between the three capitals and four types of health behaviors (i.e., physical exercise, smoking, binge drinking and stay-up). Using the sheaf coefficients technique, we then compared the relative effects of three of the capitals on health behaviors. The results suggest that cultural capital is the most influential one, which would significantly increase physical exercise and stay-up behaviors, and reduce smoking and binge drinking behaviors. Economic capital is also an important predictor, that may reduce smoking behavior but increase binge drinking and stay-up behaviors. Social capital has shown the least importance, although it would still be saliently associated with physical exercise, smoking and stay-up behaviors. In addition, some significant group disparities are also identified. This article is one of the first to explain health behavior inequalities through a Bourdieusian capital-based approach in Chinese contexts.},

Methods: This is a Web-based cross-sectional survey conducted on the JD Health platform, which resulted in 15,000 respondents having participated in this survey. The eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (EHLQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used. The Pearson correlation was used to analyse the relationship between eHealth literacy and depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder. Results: The score of eHealth literacy was 48.88 ± 8.46, and 11.4\%, 6.8\% and 20.1\% of respondents experienced moderate to severe depression, insomnia and posttraumatic stress disorder. eHealth literacy negatively correlated with depression (r = −0.331), insomnia (r = −0.366) and post-traumatic stress disorder (r = −0.320). Conclusion: eHealth literacy is closely related to psychological status. Improving eHealth literacy may contribute to maintaining good psychological well-being. Implications for Nursing Management: It is necessary to strengthen the education of primary health care providers to enhance their ability to help community residents effectively use eHealth information.},

Network studies in the admissions department of a large public university and a private company specializing in food and animal safety products indicate that employees’ POS are similar to those of coworkers with whom they maintain advice relationships as well as to those who hold structurally equivalent positions in organizational friendship and advice networks.
